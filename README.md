## 🎯 Context

**Tinder** is the world's leading dating application, launched in 2012 by Sean Rad during a hackathon in West Hollywood. With over **65 billion matches** recorded in 2021, the app allows users to:
- Swipe right ❤️ to like a profile
- Swipe left 👎 to pass
- Match when two people like each other

However, the marketing team is facing a **decline in match rates** and seeks to understand the factors that drive user interest and attraction.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

Analyze data from a real **speed dating experiment** to identify:
- ✅ Criteria that influence mutual attraction
- 📊 User behavioral patterns
- 💡 Actionable insights to optimize Tinder profiles
- 🎯 Recommendations to improve matching rates

**Key Question**: What are the determining factors in the decision to accept a second date?

---

## 📊 Data

### Source
Controlled **speed dating experiment** organized by Tinder, where participants provided:
- Detailed profile information
- Preferences and selection criteria
- Their decision (yes/no) for a second date after each encounter

### Files
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Speed+Dating+Data.csv` | Main dataset containing speed dating results |
| `Speed+Dating+Data+Key.doc` | Variable documentation and metadata |

### Data Structure
Each row represents an **interaction between two people** during a speed date, including:
- Demographics (age, profession, interests)
- Mutual evaluations (attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, ambition...)
- **Target variable**: Acceptance or rejection of a second date
